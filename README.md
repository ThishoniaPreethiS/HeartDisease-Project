# HeartDisease-Project
The world has witnessed an explosion of data due to the advancement in technology. The data can be used to bring out insights that help in decision-making. If this data is well utilized, a disease can be detected, predicted, or even cured. The healthcare industry, in particular, incorporates a large quantity of knowledge concerning patients, disease, and treatment procedures. One of the vital organs in the human body is the heart. It circulates oxygen and other vital nutrients through the blood to different parts of the body and helps in metabolic activities. Apart from this it also helps in the removal of metabolic wastes. Thus, even minor problems in the heart can affect the whole organism. Researchers are diverting a lot of data analysis for assisting doctors to predict heart problems. This paper can explain the understanding of predictive analytics and the various machine learning algorithms where the concentration is set upon heart disease prediction to predict who will develop coronary heart disease in the near future. Machine learning techniques are used to compare accuracy among different machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithm with the highest accuracy is taken and a predictive model is built using Tableau which enables users to enter in values and get the prediction of the presence/absence probability of heart disease.
